  caveats <<~EOS
    FFmpeg is bundled with the app - no separate installation needed.

    Transparency note: Sunnify is ad-hoc signed, not notarized (notarization
    requires a paid Apple Developer membership; this is an unfunded student
    project). The install step above already removed macOS quarantine, so
    the app opens normally. Verify the build's provenance any time with:
      gh attestation verify Sunnify-macOS.zip --repo sunnypatell/sunnify-spotify-downloader
